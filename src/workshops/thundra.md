## Learn how to build a simplistic version of a blog site application in serverless and how to gain observability into the application and architecture with Thundra.

In the workshop, at first we will build blog post handling and processing parts of a blog site application from scratch step by step on AWS Lambda. Applications will be interacted and pipelined with each other through AWS services like API Gateway, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB and many others. We will grasp the importance of observability in distributed serverless applications and learn how to monitor this application s with CloudWatch, X-Ray and Thundra.
Learning objectives will be:

-   Understanding the internals and capabilities of AWS components in a serverless architecture.
-   Understanding of why observability is crucial for your application
-   The ways of gaining observability with cloud provided solutions and with Thundra
